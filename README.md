# MU AKS KM UI app

Notes:

- a react app that reads rest `~/api/v1/provinces-territories` endpoint from your  `<PLACEHOLDER>-mu-aks-api-km` app and display Canadian provinces/territories information.

- Your goal is to deploy this application to our AKS cluster and connect to the deployed rest api in the cluster. Existing code works fine and updating it won't necessary bring you any extra credits - the app development part is not the point for this test.

- `nginx template` and `index.html` has been set up so that you can inject API_URL when it runs in Docker/Kubernetes.

- You are responsible for adding necessary **projects/files** to work with **Docker/Kubernetes/Helm/JGP...**

- Please save and commit all your changes by the end of the KM.

Happy KM-ing!
